Wsg, I am some random idiot who just codes what I wanna code tbh,
I jus only make private resportories for works that I got ai to do. (I can't code so I just do that for now)
I only know ruby a bit.
Python is kinda easy.
Lua is err, I never done it.
I just a chill guy, I ain't care as long as my code don't get stolen. (My code is made by me, not by ai, ai only codes for me cuz I jus lazy rn.
I'm just a beginner, plus it's Feburary, give your homeboy some time to try 🙏 
I jus send memes when I want tbh, 🤷‍♂️
This readme file is jus to sy hi to whoever somehow finds my profile.
I am gonna try to work on something whatever, prob try to mod the source SDK at home, using my code to import into it and stuff, once I learn what code Source has, (I won't copy valve since they spent hard work.)
Idk what SDK even means so, I just say the randomest stuff and not even know what I am saying, so I just say whatever I wanna say.
Btw I just love github its easy to use so I just use it.
I use a windows, IOS, etc.  
I can't code a big game on here since I ain't the main character. I am just a NPC.
But Unreal Engine 5 and Unity could maybe get me started. 
I might make my first game on unreal, then use most of my skills on Unity and post it on my github page, it's just simple work I do, once I get a few thousand, idk.
But I won't make a game company, I jus can't handle that work, I jus wanna have fun.
I don't know maybe it'll work.
